Contribution Principles

Summary

We welcome all contributions the digcoll_retriever system repository. We value making an inclusive and respectful place to have discussions about feature requests, file bug reports and dialog about design decisions.

Contributing bug reports

If you find a problem with our code base, please let us know immediately. You can do this by submitting a new issue with a short title summarizing the bug and a lengthy description of the bug. This description should include

a title with the word BUG spelled like that and in all capital letters as the first word
a brief narrative of what you were trying to accomplish when you encountered the bug
a narrative describing the steps you took through the system in order to accomplish this task
a description of the error report (if any) that was displayed to you when you encountered the bug
Before you submit the bug report, please remember to label the issue with the bug report label.

Contributing feature requests

If there is something that this system is not doing for you that you would like it to do, please let us know! We cannot get better without constructive criticism and feedback. Plesae, submt a new issue with a title and a lengthy description of the feature you are requesting. This description should include

a title with the phrase FEATURE REQUEST spelled like that and in all capital letters as the first two words
a brief narrative about what you would like to be able to accomplish
a description about why you are trying to accomplish this task
a discussion about why you think this feature request is important
Before you submit the feature request, please remember to label the issue with the feature request label.

Once you submit the feature request, the community will have 2 weeks to dsicuss the request and weigh the pros and cons. We encourage you to stay active in the discussion and we encourage all participants that the code of conduct applies to all discussions.

After 2 weeks, the governing body will review the feature request and all discussion from the community. During this review, they will come to a decision about whether to include the feature request in a new version of the system.

Contributing Code Changes

If you want to contribute code, you should

clone the repository
make a new branch named something descriptive that reflects the change you are positing
submit a pull request with a brief explanation of why you think this change needs to be made and how you believe that your change is the best approach
After that, the whole team will review your changes and begin a discussion in the Pull Request. We insist on respectful and inclusive dialog and language during the entirety of this discussion. Anyone who violates tihs principle will be pulled aside for separate discussion. We encourage you to participate in this discussion.

This discussion will last approximately one full work from the day that you submit the pull request. If you sumit on Wednesday, the discussion will occur the following week from Monday-Friday. On Friday, if all parties have agreed that your changes truly are the best solution to the problem and appropriate for the project and there are no changes that need to be made the pull request will be accepted.

If there are changes that need to be made, the pull request will be rejected and you should make the recommended changes and submit a new pull request. A second pull request will not require the full week of discussion, only enough time for everyone on the governing group to review the changes and approve them. Once the whole governing group has approved the changes, the pull request will be accepted.
